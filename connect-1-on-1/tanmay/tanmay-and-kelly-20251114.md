    Kelly apologized for being late to the meeting and asked if Tanmay had anything to discuss before they started.
- Kelly asked Tanmay if he was having issues supporting Shantanu. Tanmay explained he had been out for the past two weeks due to personal reasons and hadn't interacted much with Shantanu, but he did review some code changes Shantanu made.
- Kelly wanted to ensure Shantanu was progressing and had the support he needed without overburdening Tanmay. Tanmay confirmed he always guides Shantanu directly if he has any queries.
- Kelly asked Tanmay about his preferred IDE, noting that Thom wants everyone to switch to VS Code and he needs justification for an Intellij license. Tanmay stated that Intellij is better for debugging due to their familiarity and better debugging capabilities, and that another team member also wants Intellij.
- Kelly explained that Tom might be okay with senior developers using Intellij, but Tanmay clarified that both he and the other developer need Intellij for individual debugging purposes, as they cannot always interact with each other for debugging.
- Tanmay mentioned he received an updated swagger for ticket 4867 and has started implementation. He also confirmed that for partial fulfillment scenarios, they need to use a single call for the shipment, instead of separate allocate, fulfill, and deallocate calls. He will confirm the specific shipment ID to pass and will connect with Kelly if he gets stuck.

Here are the key takeaways from the discussion:

- **Intellij License Justification:** Tanmay and another team member require Intellij for better debugging and familiarity, especially for individual debugging, despite Tom's preference for VS Code. Kelly will try to secure the Intellij license for them.
- **Ticket 4867 Implementation:** Tanmay has started implementing ticket 4867, which involves using an updated swagger for partial fulfillment scenarios. They will use a single call for shipment instead of multiple calls, and Tanmay will confirm the shipment ID. He will connect with Kelly if he encounters any issues.
- **Jon Snow's Support:** Kelly wanted to ensure Jon Snow was progressing well and receiving adequate support without over-relying on Tanmay. Tanmay confirmed he provides guidance to Jon Snow when needed.

Here are the action items from the discussion:

- **Kelly Taylor:**
    - Request an Intellij license for Tanmay and another team member, providing justification by today.
- **Tanmay Bhabire:**
    - Confirm the specific shipment ID to pass for ticket 4867.
    - Connect with Kelly if he gets stuck during the implementation of ticket 4867.
