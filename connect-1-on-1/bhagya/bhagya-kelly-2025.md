I assigned FFMT-4972 to myself.
- Ask Srikanth if they can do a poll for update once they receive the event...or potentially add a delay in pulling the shipment for a second or 2 once the event is received

Bhagya fixed https://kibo.atlassian.net/browse/FFMT-5109 but also requires a COM fix...
- Discuss with Srikanth

Explicitly uses VS Code, but has issues with differing Java versions...
- I told her about JEnv and vs code workspace and settings file to set java version per project. She will get it going

Uses Claude Code but hit her $25 budget after only a few requests.
- I told her she can request a higher budget, but the LLM she sets is the cause...so told her my way to manage my budget is by using Claude Haiku 4.5 ...she said that she will try this

Other than the typical work questions, she seems to be generally ok and has suggicient work assigned. I reminded her of the ongoing team tickets she can contribute to if out of work...test coverage and production logging cleanup
