The discussion centered on implementing a process change to move test plan creation and approval to an upfront phase, ensuring stories are fully defined and tested _before_ a sprint starts.

- **Shift in Process Focus:** The team agreed on the need to move test plan creation and approval to a phase _before_ a story is selected for a sprint. The goal is to improve consistency, quality, and predictability, allowing the sprint itself to be purely focused on execution.
- **New Workflow Proposed:** Kelly Taylor presented a revised story workflow that introduces a "Test Planning" state and a test plan approval step, serving as a mandatory gate before a ticket can be marked "Ready for Dev."
- **Capacity Concerns:** Key concerns were raised about how developers, who are often working on time-sensitive tickets, will find the capacity to perform this required upfront planning and grooming work for the next sprint.
- **Capacity Adjustment:** Thomas Phipps suggested that the team must adjust the number of story points they commit to in a sprint, allocating necessary time (~10% overhead) for the out-of-band preparatory work.
- **Executive Buy-in:** Thomas Phipps took an action item to seek executive buy-in to manage expectations regarding a possible initial temporary decrease in velocity due to the focus on upfront planning and quality.
- **Pilot Rollout:** Kelly Taylor will roll out the new workflow for the **FFMT project**. The new process will be piloted by the **catalog and fulfillment team** (Paul Theron and Kelly Taylor) for the next sprint to gather feedback.
- **Future Automation:** The team will explore leveraging **autonomous agents** to automate tasks like test creation and documentation, aiming to reduce the manual workload associated with the new process.


Here are the key takeaways and decisions from the meeting:

- **Process Change Approved:** Test plan creation and approval must be completed _before_ a story is selected for development, ensuring sprints are focused on execution rather than planning.
- **New Workflow Implemented:** A "Test Planning" state and an approval gate will be added to the story workflow to ensure tickets are fully defined and tested before entering the "Ready for Dev" state.
- **Capacity Adjustment:** Teams will initially reduce the number of story points committed to a sprint to allocate time for the new upfront planning work.
- **Pilot Program:** The new workflow will be piloted immediately for the **FFMT project** by the **catalog and fulfillment team**.
- **Executive Buy-in:** Thomas Phipps will get executive buy-in to set expectations around the process change, particularly regarding any temporary impact on team velocity.


The following action items were confirmed during the meeting:

- **Kelly Taylor:**
    - Roll out the new test planning workflow for the **FFMT project** to start the pilot phase.
    - Reach out to Paul Theron to initiate the new workflow pilot with the catalog and fulfillment team.
    - Conduct proof-of-concept (POC) work using autonomous agents for tasks such as creating documentation or tests.
- **Paul Theron and  (Team: Catalog and Fulfillment):**
    - Participate in the pilot implementation of the new test planning workflow for the CAT and FFMT Jira projects.
- **Thomas Phipps:**
    - Secure executive buy-in for the process change proposal to ensure shared accountability and manage expectations regarding quality and throughput.
