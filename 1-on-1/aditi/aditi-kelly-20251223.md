The discussion focused on project updates, team dynamics, and planning for the next release.

- **3D View Update:** Aditi confirmed her 3D view calculations are working as expected, and she resolved a logic issue found during Amol's testing. She will ask Amit to update the story description and Aslam to update the test scenarios.
- **Communication:** Aditi and the team agreed to consolidate feedback from Amit and Amol into a list to discuss at a scheduled time rather than flooding communication channels.
- **Reporting Structure:** Aditi expressed satisfaction with Kelly as her direct manager/lead, as Kelly has better visibility into her work compared to others.
- **Bhagya's Involvement:** Kelly and Aditi agreed to include Bhagya more in sprint work by having her review pull requests and assigning her a ticket to ensure she is not isolated to support tasks.
- **Cartonization Feature:** The team is targeting the Cartonization APIs (MVP) for the 25:52 release, which is scheduled to deploy on January 6th. Aditi will create the ticket for her remaining extension work.
- **Total Wine BPM:** Aditi took on the action item to coordinate on the snapshot file, upload it to Nexus, and create the container for the Total Wine BPM in the GCP sandbox environment.
- **Dropship and Testing:** Kelly still needs to complete the handler class for the Dropship BPM partial fulfillment logic. The team also discussed minimizing the use of Spring application context loading for unit tests to speed up execution and improve the testing pattern for new team members.
- **Holiday Contact:** Aditi confirmed she and Thanay will be available on their mobile phones for urgent issues during the upcoming holiday period.
