Summary of the meeting discussion:

- **Cartonization Progress:** Aditi is running with the cartonization work and is expected to demo some of the progress on Monday. The core logic is a new 'packing suggestions' API in the fulfillment service, starting with a total volume algorithm.
- **Infrastructure/DevOps Updates:** Kelly is following up on a MongoDB driver pull request and plans to work on Open Telemetry integration. Ethan is currently working on an issue where Redis nodes appear disconnected after a restart.
- **Rate Shopping and Performance:** Kelly will assist Travis with generating API contracts for the SMART Rate shopping feature and will provide oversight for his work on memory profiling and heap control.
- **JIRA Workflow Update:** Kelly presented a new JIRA workflow, _Kiba story with test planning_, which requires a test plan to be approved before a story can move to "Ready for Dev" and be added to a sprint. This flow will be applied to Stories only for the Fulfillment and Catalog teams.
- **Tracking Workload:** To account for the work involved in defining test plans before the sprint, they agreed to use a single, recurring sprint task for the team to track time spent on cleanup, production log review, and test coverage improvements.
- **Team Capacity and Rework:** Kelly shared that the team is at capacity and noted that losing a previous resource has led to less rework. She is satisfied with the contributions of Bhagya and feels the team can function without immediately hiring a replacement.
- **Reporting Structure:** Rakesh confirmed that the organizational reporting structure change is in progress, which will result in Kelly gaining three direct reports (Aditi, Bhagya, and one other developer) and needing to become familiar with Indian HR processes.
- **Time Off:** Rakesh approved Kelly taking time off during the last week of the year for Christmas, with the understanding that she will remain available in case of emergencies.
