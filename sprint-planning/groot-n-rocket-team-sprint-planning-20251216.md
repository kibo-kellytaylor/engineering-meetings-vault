The team discussed several key topics during the sprint planning meeting:

- **Assembly Shipments for Ship to Home (STH) Enhancement:** A new, urgent enhancement request was raised by Rakesh for assembly shipments for STH for AFG, with an end-of-January delivery target. Madhulika Saxena will follow up with Rakesh and Sachin to confirm the requirements and priority.
- **Assembly Delivery Workflows:** The team confirmed that assembly support currently exists for BOPUS (Buy Online, Pick Up in Store) and Enhanced Delivery. They agreed that if STH assembly is implemented, it should be integrated into the existing STH workflow for consistency.
- **Action Items for STH:** Kelly Taylor will create stories for the STH assembly feature and assign Tommy to begin the analysis and research work. Tanmay Bhabire will be assigned the new STH assembly stories.
- **Other Sprint Commitments:** Aditi Sawant is focused on Cartonization, and Kelly Taylor plans to complete a story for Dropship partial support this sprint. Jordan Sinclair did not commit to any work this sprint.
- **Order Creation Automation:** Jordan Sinclair raised concerns about the current difficulties in maintaining order creation automation for assembly without using the storefront. Kelly Taylor will investigate potential solutions, such as extending the create order functionality.
- **Documentation Project Update:** Madhulika Saxena informed the team about a documentation refresh project, led by Ram and Ty, to convert existing user guides and videos to a new format using the application Guided, with a due date of December 20th.
- **IntelliJ License:** Kelly clarified that the company is moving toward Visual Studio Code, so new IntelliJ licenses are not being issued; users must utilize the perpetual license, and Kelly will provide the necessary activation code to Tanmay.
