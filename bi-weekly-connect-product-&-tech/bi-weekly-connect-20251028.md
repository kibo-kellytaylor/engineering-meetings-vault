- Kelly Taylor and Madhulika Saxena discussed moving the meeting half an hour earlier, which was approved.
- Rakesh Dontula provided updates on Q4 items, including finalizing the Q4 roadmap and prioritizing bugs.
- Sachin Sharma discussed with Ram Venkataraman about 153 engineering tickets, with 77 being actionable and 80 not actionable for various reasons, including clients no longer following up or fixes already deployed.
- Rakesh Dontula reported on Dropship work in progress, including building vendor objects and APIs to support integration with order fulfillment systems. Ram Venkataraman emphasized that Dropship features should be behind a tenant flag and not accessible to Office Depot due to a contractual situation.
- Kelly Taylor explained that the BPM changes for Dropship are in progress and that the Jenkins jobs for Fleet Farm are failing, preventing the deployment of published contracts. Ram Venkataraman suggested addressing this as a defect.
- Rakesh Dontula updated on B2B customer roles, account hierarchy permissions, and B2B attribute extensibility for order routing, all of which are in progress. Amit Ugane mentioned using V0, an AI tool, for generating wires and React code for B2B mockups.
- Rutvee Shah noted that the start date for the Cartoonization project, which integrates with Packsize, needs to be changed due to dependencies on the fulfillment team. Ram Venkataraman asked about changing the pricing model for cartonization and EDD given the costs associated with services like EasyPost.
- Ram Venkataraman inquired about the consistency of the "agentic" feature in demos, as it has not been working reliably. Kevin Watts clarified that it's not turned on for all sandboxes and requires specific settings.
- The "Inventory configure and explain" item was clarified to be only the order routing agent, and not something currently being worked on by Sachin Sharma and Kevin Watts' team.
- Ram Venkataraman suggested that operational dashboards should be wired into MCP (Master Control Program) for NRF (National Retail Federation) launch, and Sachin Sharma confirmed it's on their internal list.
- Rakesh Dontula mentioned that the Country 16 project will be deployed to sandbox soon, with a production deadline extended to the end of January.
- Rakesh Dontula also discussed the Inventory Modernization project, a big effort to move away from PHP, which will start in Q4 and continue into Q1. Michael Kytka clarified that it will migrate the vast majority of PHP but not all of it, and emphasized the need for a clear migration approach to avoid customer issues and to scale for larger clients like H&M.


Here's a summary of the discussion from the last two minutes:

- Ram Venkataraman encouraged Michael Kytka to approach the Inventory Modernization effort with a clear understanding of the investment and ROI, questioning if the current system is sufficient for most customers or if the new system is truly necessary for scaling to larger clients.
- Michael Kytka explained that the modernization is needed to scale for customers like H&M and address vulnerabilities, even though the current system handles a large volume of updates.
- Ram Venkataraman expressed concern about the time it would take to migrate customers and avoid issues, suggesting a separate design session with Tom to discuss the move approach and ensure business value.


Here are the key takeaways from the discussion:

- **Q4 Roadmap and Bugs:** The Q4 roadmap has been finalized, and a list of prioritized bugs has been assigned to each team. There are 153 engineering tickets in total, with 77 being actionable and 80 deemed not actionable due to various reasons.
- **Dropship Development:** Work is in progress on Dropship, including building vendor objects and APIs for integration with order fulfillment systems. It was emphasized that Dropship features must be behind a tenant flag and not accessible to Office Depot due to contractual agreements.
- **BPM Changes and Jenkins Jobs:** BPM changes for Dropship are ongoing, but Jenkins jobs for Fleet Farm are failing, preventing the deployment of published contracts. This issue was suggested to be addressed as a defect.
- **B2B Customer Features:** B2B customer roles, account hierarchy permissions, and B2B attribute extensibility for order routing are all in progress. V0, an AI tool, is being used to generate wires and React code for B2B mockups.
- **Cartoonization Project:** The start date for the Cartoonization project, which integrates with Packsize, needs to be adjusted due to dependencies on the fulfillment team. There will also be a change in the pricing model for cartonization and EDD to account for costs from services like EasyPost.
- **Agentic Feature Demos:** The "agentic" feature has been inconsistently working in demos, and it was clarified that it requires specific settings and is not enabled for all sandboxes.
- **Operational Dashboards:** It was suggested that operational dashboards should be integrated with MCP (Master Control Program) for the NRF launch in January.
- **Country 16 Project:** The Country 16 project will be deployed to the sandbox soon, with the production deadline extended to the end of January.
- **Inventory Modernization:** A significant project to modernize inventory workflows and move away from PHP is starting in Q4 and will continue into Q1. This effort aims to scale for larger customers like H&M and address vulnerabilities, but a clear migration strategy and ROI assessment are needed.
