Here's a summary of the discussion:

- **Sandbox Environments:** Jordan Sinclair reported UI stability issues and a cash-related issue on the fulfillment side in sandbox environments, except for PROD-SB2. Rakesh Dontula will investigate if PROD-SB2 is not being used and consider disabling that environment. Connor Workman and Kevin Watts clarified that PROD-SB2 is intended for partners and system integrators to evaluate the platform without impacting sales. Rakesh noted that prospects are also using sandbox, leading to requests to restore expired sandboxes.
- **Peak Prep and Performance Testing:**
    - **Kelly Taylor's team:** Performance testing is in progress. Fixes for the managed stock issue and stress testing bypass are done. Failover for Redis will be addressed in the next sprint.
    - **Paul Theron's team (Catalog and Commerce Inventory):** Performance testing is complete, with no major changes needed. They noted a need for better monitoring and expressed interest in how other teams are looking at their stats in AWS Grafana.
    - **Commerce team:** Raghavendra Patlola stated that performance testing for Commerce will start next sprint, focusing on customer, location, and reservation aspects. Rakesh will push a fix for an outstanding issue with reservations or subscriptions.
    - **Charlie's team:** Jordan Sinclair reported that performance testing preparations haven't started yet and will coordinate to create tickets and ensure no other features are affected.
- **Open Telemetry and Grafana Dashboards:** Rakesh suggested leveraging open telemetry for all teams to add logs for troubleshooting. Kevin Watts offered to set up a session with Sonal to explain open telemetry. Kelly Taylor mentioned that a fix for order routing in Java apps is available but not yet merged. Paul asked about Grafana for GCP, and Connor confirmed its existence for both production and dev environments, though the dev environment only has Prometheus metrics. Rakesh suggested copying AWS dashboards to GCP. Michael Kytka mentioned his team has done a lot of performance testing related to peak.
- **Allstacks Developer Survey:** Rakesh asked about the all-stack survey participation from the Commerce and Inventory teams. Nelly Turdean mentioned that the team was confused because they don't have access to "all stacks" and thought the survey was related to a tool. Amit Ugane also expressed similar confusion. Rakesh clarified that the survey is initiated from "all stacks" because the Developer Experience product, which supports the survey, is managed by "all stacks." Nelly also reported that one team member did not receive the survey notification, and Rakesh asked for the team member's name to check the team roster. Paul questioned why the survey came from "all stacks" and if they would parse the data. Rakesh explained that the Developer Experience product, supported by "all stacks," creates and sends the survey to engineering teams to gauge their feelings on processes and product definition.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Peak Prep and Performance Testing:**
    - Kelly Taylor's team has performance testing in progress, with fixes for managed stock and stress testing bypass completed. Failover for Redis will be addressed next sprint.
    - Paul Theron's team (Catalog and Commerce Inventory) finished performance testing, noting a need for better monitoring and interest in how other teams track stats in AWS Grafana.
    - Raghavendra Patlola's Commerce team will start performance testing next sprint, and Rakesh will push a fix for a reservation/subscription issue.
    - Jordan Sinclair reported that Charlie's team hasn't started performance testing preparations yet and will coordinate to create tickets.
    - Michael Kytka's team has completed significant performance testing for refresh and adjust, achieving performance increases, and for Autozone's file processor. They still need to cover suggestion and candidates.
- **Open Telemetry and Grafana Dashboards:** Rakesh suggested leveraging open telemetry for all teams for troubleshooting. Kevin Watts will set up a session with Sonal to explain it. There are Grafana dashboards for GCP production and dev environments (dev only has Prometheus metrics), and Rakesh suggested copying AWS dashboards to GCP.
- **Q4 Roadmap and Releases:** Rakesh is working to finalize the Q4 roadmap and will provide dates for features, with production releases scheduled for mid-January. Sandbox releases will continue every two weeks.
- **All Stacks Survey:** Rakesh encouraged participation in the All Stacks survey, clarifying that it's a Developer Experience product supported by All Stacks to gather feedback on processes and product definition. Nelly Turdean and Amit Ugane noted confusion about the survey's name and its relation to a tool.
- **Hiring Updates:** A candidate for Michael Kytka's team ghosted. Open roles include a support engineer for the catalog team, an SD role, and a UI engineer. A new hire, Zaid, will be joining later this month to help with Autozone, vendor management portals, and identic tasks, focusing on C# and React skills.
