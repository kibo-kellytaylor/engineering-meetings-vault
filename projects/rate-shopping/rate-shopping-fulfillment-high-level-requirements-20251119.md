Based on the discussion, here is a summary of the key points:

- **Autozone Hotfix Issue:** Madhulika and Rakesh discussed a critical Autozone issue where orders for heavy items were getting canceled because the Estimated Delivery Date (EDD) call was not honoring an item filter, and Rakesh agreed to follow up with details and a recommended fix timeline by the end of the day.
- **Rate Shopping Proposal:** The team introduced rate shopping in fulfillment to allow fulfillers visibility into other carriers and shipping methods that are more cost-effective while still meeting the promised service level.
- **Display Logic Decision:** They decided on a hybrid display approach where the fulfillment user interface (UI) will show all available rates, sorted from lowest to highest cost.
- **Service Level Guidance:** The UI will highlight the most cost-effective option and clearly indicate which options meet the service level the customer selected to help prevent manual errors.
- **Technical Implementation:** The fulfillment API will fetch configured carriers from the Location Group settings, call the Shipping Runtime (SRT) API for rates, and enrich the response with the 'keyboard duration' (e.g., Two Day) for the UI to display.
- **Team Ownership:** The work to build the rate shopping feature is primarily contained within the Fulfillment and Headless teams.


Here are the key takeaways and decisions from the discussion:

- **Autozone Hotfix Follow-up:** Rakesh Dontula will gather details on the required hotfix for the Autozone issue and communicate a fix timeline, aiming for the customer's request of Tuesday, next week.
- **Rate Shopping Feature:** It was decided to add a rate shopping feature in fulfillment to provide fulfillers with visibility into carriers and rates for cost optimization in ship-to-direction orders.
- **Flexible Display of Rates:** The plan is to display all available carrier rates to the user, not just the cheapest single option.
- **Cost and Service Level Indicators:** The display will be sorted by cost (lowest to highest), and a visual indicator will be used to highlight the most cost-effective option and identify which rates meet the customer's promised service level.
- **Technical Implementation Ownership:** The main development work for this feature will be handled by the Fulfillment team API, which will integrate with the Shipping Runtime (SRT) to fetch and process rates before sending them to the UI.


Here are the confirmed action items from the meeting:

- **Madhulika Saxena:**
    - Clean up and modify the Rate Shopping requirements document based on the discussion, particularly regarding the display logic for constrained/unconstrained modes, and share it with the team.
- **Rakesh Dontula:**
    - Gather details on the required hotfix for the Autozone issue and communicate a decision on the fix timeline (aiming for Tuesday of next week) to Madhulika by the end of the day today.
    - Start development work on the fulfillment API, which will be responsible for fetching carrier and service type configurations, calling the Shipping Runtime (SRT) for rates, and enhancing the response with the service level duration (keyboard duration) for the UI.


Madhulika Saxena introduced the problem of a lack of visibility for users to switch to a more cost-effective carrier while still meeting the promised service level during fulfillment, noting that users currently cannot optimize for cost, and she proposed adding rate shopping in fulfillment, specifically limited to direct ship where carriers are used, which would require integration with shipping runtime, a component where the commerce team is involved. Madhulika Saxena detailed two potential rate shopping modes: "constrained rate shopping," where the customer-selected service level, such as two-day shipping, must be respected, and "unconstrained rate shopping," where there is no specific service level promised or the client chooses to disregard set service levels to select the cheapest method. Kelly Taylor asked how the two-day service level is currently mapped to a carrier type or shipment, and both Srikanth Bandlamudi and Madhulika Saxena explained that today, the service level is hardcoded to a carrier in the backend, with Srikanth Bandlamudi clarifying that each carrier has its own setup for defining one-day, two-day, and three-day options.

Madhulika Saxena explained that each carrier has its own mapping for one, two, or three-day service levels, which are essential for fulfillment to correctly process orders, and gave an example of how FedEx's standard one-day service might map to FedEx overnight. Rakesh Dontula noted that while e-commerce clients typically send the full carrier and service level, MS customers might only send different types of one or two days, leading him to question if there is a concept like "FedEx one day" or if the system is simply mapping KBO one, two, and three-day levels to specific carrier service levels, which Madhulika Saxena confirmed to be the case. Madhulika Saxena and Rakesh Dontula discussed allowing rate shopping based on duration for users using KBO defaults, and Madhulika Saxena confirmed that the service level will be honored unless the client specifically opts to disregard it, adding that they should allow modes for both honoring and disregarding the service level.

Rakesh Dontula clarified that "one day" is not an e-commerce concept, but rather a concept for Microsoft, as the e-commerce front end displays rates by carrier and service, like UPS ground, which led Madhulika Saxena to suggest that an order can either come in with the actual carrier selected or with a concept like "one day" or "two day" which would then require mapping. Rakesh Dontula confirmed that when an order is imported, they might receive "one day," "two day," or "standard," and in the case where the customer has already selected a specific carrier and service level, such as UPS ground, the location group concept mapping is not applied, which Rutvee Shah questioned, wondering if the location group default is ignored in e-commerce cases. Madhulika Saxena suggested that for rate shopping when UPS ground is selected, two options exist: not to do rate shopping or to translate UPS ground's timeline and use that as the service level constraint for rate shopping, a preference which she leaned towards because it would allow rate shopping, while Rakesh Dontula agreed that the fulfiller should be able to see a list of service levels that are cheaper, regardless of the initial selection.

Rakesh Dontula suggested that users should be able to override the one-day shipping constraint because there might be scenarios, such as weather issues or back-ordered items, where the service level cannot be met, necessitating the choice of the next best available option based on cost. While Madhulika Saxena initially considered constraining the rates returned by the one-day service level, she later proposed a hybrid approach following Rakesh Dontula’s suggestion to show all rates, but with intelligence that highlights which options meet the promised service level and which do not. Rutvee Shah supported Madhulika Saxena's concern that leaving the selection entirely to the user defeats the purpose of rate shopping, which is to reduce manual errors, prompting Madhulika Saxena to suggest displaying a warning if a user selects an option that does not meet the service level.

Rakesh Dontula wondered if they should only pull specific service levels from the location group configurations because the location only supports certain carriers and service levels, a point Srikanth Bandlamudi agreed with because shopping happens at a particular location. Rutvee Shah asked Madhulika Saxena if rate shopping provides multiple options or just the cheapest one, leading Madhulika Saxena to explain that while IBM Sterling might offer the cheapest rate across carriers, their implementation of rate shopping should allow for a comparison of different carrier methods and rates, and that they would need to check with Srikanth Bandlamudi if their existing services could determine the cheapest rate or if the logic would have to be built in. Srikanth Bandlamudi confirmed that they would have to check and that the carriers would not tell them which rate is the cheapest, and Madhulika Saxena added that the logic for sorting the rates would need to be handled by the shipping runtime, which is their control tower and not an external company like in other features.

Rakesh Dontula questioned the necessity of building intelligence into the API if the requirement is to display all available options for the user to choose from, noting that Madhulika Saxena initially stated that everything would be displayed. Madhulika Saxena clarified that all carriers should be displayed, sorted by lowest cost, and the most cost-effective option highlighted, suggesting that the Shipping Runtime (SRT) should handle this logic, including identifying rates that meet the service level requirement. Rakesh Dontula then proposed that the SRT should simply return all rates and the UI could handle the sorting, display, and highlighting of the cheapest option that meets the service level agreement (SLA), a simpler approach which Madhulika Saxena ultimately agreed with.

Rakesh Dontula explained that the system sorts by price and requires knowing the duration of the rate to compare it against the customer's selected duration, adding that they will use EasyPost for retrieving rates but must consider location group-specific configurations to fetch only the carriers and service levels configured for that location before displaying everything to the user. Madhulika Saxena agreed with the recommendations, noting that everything resides in KBO, and stated she would clean up her first-level draft based on the discussion, particularly clarifying the separation between constrained and unconstrained options, which will both be displayed to allow the shopper to decide, even if constrained. Srikanth Bandlamudi confirmed that the existing 'Get Rates Address' API accepts carrier IDs and shipping service types, which means the caller must send these based on location group configuration, leading Rakesh Dontula and Kelly Taylor to agree that another API in the fulfillment layer is needed to look up the location configuration.

Latest update

Rakesh Dontula suggested that the response format of an API in fulfillment should include the service type and its duration to indicate the delivery time, though he noted that this information is not currently included in the shipping runtime response. Madhulika Saxena agreed with the concept of including transit time, similar to how it's used for Estimated Delivery (ED), though Rakesh Dontula clarified that while the delivery date comes from the carrier, there is a concept of a standard duration, like five to seven business days for FedEx Ground, which needs to be mapped from LGC settings to a display format such as "keyboard two day." The discussion concluded with Rakesh Dontula confirming that the next steps involve the fulfillment API handling the rates request, fetching carrier and service type configurations, calling the shipping runtime, and enhancing the response with the keyboard duration before sending it to the UI, which Kelly Taylor affirmed made sense and Madhulika Saxena noted meant the work appeared to be self-contained between headless and fulfillment.
