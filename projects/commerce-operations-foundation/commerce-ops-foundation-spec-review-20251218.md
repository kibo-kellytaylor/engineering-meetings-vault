**Summary**

- The discussion centered on reviewing the Commerce Operations Foundation's MCP spec, which is an API standard for order management for use with LLMs.
- Thomas Phipps explained that participation is a marketing motion and partnership aimed at increasing Kibo's industry visibility and thought leadership.
- The spec focuses on bare-bones order management tools, including creation and updates of orders, and retrieval of products, inventory, customers, and fulfillments.
- Kelly Taylor's question about terminology confirmed that "fulfillment" in the spec is the analog for Kibo's "shipment."
- Raghavendra Patlola and Rakesh Dontula pointed out that the spec's "discount per unit" is a potential area of awkwardness compared to Kibo's item or order-level discounts.
- The team acknowledged that the schemas include `custom fields` to accommodate Kibo-specific attributes not covered by the core spec.
- The main action item is for attendees to spend about an hour reviewing the schemas and tools to gather feedback on missing or awkward elements.
- Thomas Phipps will create a temporary "Commerce Operation Foundation" channel and asked for notes to be submitted quickly, with the goal of meeting again tomorrow.

**Key takeaways**

- The meeting's purpose is to review the Commerce Operations Foundation's MCP spec as part of a marketing and partnership effort to increase Kibo's industry visibility.
- The spec covers core order management resources and is limited to basic functions like order creation, updates, and getting products, inventory, and fulfillments (which is Kibo's shipment entity).
- A key difference noted for feedback is the spec's use of "discount per unit," which differs from Kibo's item-level or order-level discount implementation.
- Attendees must spend time reviewing the spec's schemas and tools to provide feedback on any missing elements or awkward requirements.
- Thomas Phipps will create a temporary channel for feedback submissions, and a follow-up meeting is tentatively scheduled for tomorrow.


**Action Items**

- **All Attendees:**
    - Review the Commerce Operations Foundation spec (schemas and tools) for approximately an hour to identify and document feedback on what is missing, what the spec requires that Kibo does not do, or what would be awkward for Kibo's platform.
- **Rakesh Dontula:**
    - Gather and provide feedback on the spec by the end of the day today.
- **Thomas Phipps:**
    - Create a temporary channel for the Commerce Operation Foundation project and invite the attendees.
    - Pin relevant spec links and information to the new channel.
    - Set up a follow-up meeting for tomorrow to discuss the team's feedback.
